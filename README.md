# SE105-Programming-1
My answers for the execrises of the se105 course in SJTU.

Most of the answers are covered by tests. They should function properly,
although some of them did not get the full marks. If you find a bug please
open an issue, i will try to fix it.

Some of the answers require c++11 features, you may need to configure your compiler.

[Note: There are still some homework missing.]

也许这门课之后就没有了，真是令人遗憾。
不过如果还有这门课的话，请仅作为参考。
